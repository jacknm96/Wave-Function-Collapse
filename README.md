# Wave-Function-Collapse

This is a still a work-in-progress of my journey exploring the Wave Function Collapse algorithm. There are multiple open source examples of the algorithm online, but I wished to create mine from scratch so that I can fully understand what the algorithm is doing.

You can download the project and test it out for yourself. Simply download the source code, open the project, and hit play.

In theory, you should be able to attach your own spritemap and training data, but as I am not an artist and only have the 1 spritesheet, I cannot promise it will work. As I said, still a work-in-progress.
